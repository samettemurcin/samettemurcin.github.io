						<h3>Data Visualization Project on Work From Home vs. Back to Office</h3>
						<span class="image main"><img src="images/project5.jpg" alt="Work From Home Analytics Dashboard" /></span>
						<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, Tableau, Statistical Trend Analysis, Time Series Visualization</p>
						<p>Comprehensive analysis of remote work evolution across 18 datasets and 14 industries spanning 
						May 2020 (peak COVID-19) to October 2025. Examined the trajectory of work-from-home policies and 
						their correlation with pandemic phases to understand long-term workplace transformation trends.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
						<ul>
						   <li>Analyzed 5+ years of workplace data revealing shift from 18% remote work (May 2020 peak) 
						   to current 11%, with full on-site increasing from 54% to 64%</li>
						   <li>Identified industry variations: IT and Finance maintaining ~45% WFH rates due to digital-first 
						   nature, while Hospitality, Retail, and Manufacturing remained below 15% requiring physical presence</li>
						   <li>Discovered hybrid work model stabilization at 25%, representing sustainable balance between 
						   remote flexibility and in-office collaboration</li>
						   <li>Tracked 18.81K customers and analyzed behavioral patterns showing gradual workplace adaptation 
						   rather than forced transitions</li>
						   <li>Built interactive Tableau dashboards visualizing monthly trends across channels (Offline, 
						   Android App, Mobile, iOS, Desktop) with 93K total orders analyzed</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p><strong>Business Insights:</strong> Analysis revealed companies' revealed preference for office 
						space despite higher costs, suggesting measurable value in physical collaboration. Cross-industry 
						comparison demonstrated that optimal work model depends on task nature rather than universal policy, 
						with 7 out of 14 industries showing WFH rates below 20%.</p>

						<h3>U.S. Housing Market Trends Analysis (2005-2025)</h3>
						<span class="image main"><img src="images/project4.jpg" alt="US Housing Market Analytics" /></span>
						<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, Tableau, Time Series Analysis, Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization</p>
						<p>Comprehensive 20-year longitudinal study analyzing U.S. housing market dynamics from 2005-2025, 
						examining the relationship between home prices, mortgage rates, sales volumes, and major economic 
						events including the 2008 Financial Crisis and COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
						<ul>
						   <li>Analyzed regional disparities revealing West Coast median home prices reaching $2.3M in 2022 
						   compared to Midwest remaining under $1.6M, highlighting growing geographic wealth divide</li>
						   <li>Identified COVID-19 paradox: home sales surged 21% (2019-2020) as mortgage rates hit historic 
						   3% lows, driven by remote work trends and increased household savings despite global pandemic</li>
						   <li>Quantified Fed rate impact: mortgage rate increases from 3% to 8% (2022-2024) caused 45% 
						   plunge in new home sales, demonstrating strongest inverse correlation in dataset</li>
						   <li>Comparative crisis analysis: 2008 Financial Crisis required 7+ years for market recovery, while 
						   2020 COVID-19 impact showed immediate rebound due to unprecedented monetary policy interventions</li>
						   <li>Built interactive Tableau dashboards with economic event annotations and multi-dimensional 
						   filtering across regions, time periods, and housing metrics</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p><strong>Technical Approach:</strong> Collected data from Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) 
						and U.S. Census Bureau. Performed data quality assessment and missing value analysis using Python. 
						Applied median-based statistics instead of averages to avoid luxury property outlier distortion, 
						ensuring accurate market representation across diverse price ranges.</p>

						<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python (pandas, NumPy), Tableau, Statistical Analysis, Data Validation</p>
						<p>Analyzed Boston's municipal performance data using CityScore metrics to identify operational 
						bottlenecks and high-performing services across 15+ city departments. Performed comprehensive 
						data cleaning, missing value analysis, and statistical validation against official city dashboards 
						to ensure accuracy and actionable insights.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
						<ul>
						   <li>Top Performers: Library usage at 1.747 (74% above target), demonstrating exceptional 
						   community engagement and resource utilization</li>
						   <li>Public Safety success: Shooting incidents reduced by 37%, reflecting effective law 
						   enforcement and community programs</li>
						   <li>Code Enforcement and Trash Collection maintaining strong performance at 1.22+ scores, 
						   exceeding operational targets</li>
						   <li>Critical delays identified: Sign installation at 0.418 (only 42% on-time completion), 
						   Streetlight repairs at 0.507, and Pothole repairs at 0.730—flagging urgent need for resource 
						   reallocation</li>
						   <li>Trend analysis showing monthly CityScore stability around 1.0 baseline with September 
						   uptick to 1.055, indicating positive momentum in overall city performance</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p><strong>Technical Approach:</strong> Cleaned and processed raw municipal data using Python, 
						handled missing values and data quality issues, performed statistical analysis to validate findings, 
						and built interactive Tableau dashboard enabling drill-down analysis by department and time period 
						for data-driven resource allocation recommendations.</p>
